Projects - Scopes and Russian Dolls

Two exercises exploring scope.

Scopes
The user is able to dynamically add button groups to a html page. The new buttons can add or subtract to a counter and be reset
or deleted.

Russian Dolls
Uses the idea of nested Russian Dolls. The user selects a button that displays a doll along with a name and color (color is not
accurate). I misspelled Russian on the files names.
